# DataAnalysis_Projects
This repository is a collection of data analysis projects using various real world data sets I'm interested in. It currently contains two projects:
* Machine Learning Model on Student Loan data
* Analysising the last 5000 years of Solar Eclipse Data

For more details on how each of these projects work, feel free to browse the wiki!

## Getting Started
These instructions should get my work up and running on your local machine
### Prerequisites
These projects were written on [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/). Additionally, I highly recommend creating virtual environments for each of them using [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).
To install pipenv,
```
py -m pip install pipenv
```
### Installing libraries
To install the required libraries into your virtual environment,
```
py -m pipenv install numpy
py -m pipenv install pandas
py -m pipenv install itertools
py -m pipenv install seaborn
py -m pipenv install matplotlib
py -m pipenv install sklearn
```

## Authors
The Eclipse project is part of my independent research.
The Machine Learning Student Loans project is based off code I had learnt from an online course.

## Built with
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
